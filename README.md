ffm_scala
=========

This is a Scala implementation of Phil Zylstra's forest flammability model.

The model was originally developed by Phil as an MS Excel application, and
subsequently implemented as a C++ program by Chris Thomas. 

This Scala version is a port of the C++ sources.

This branch was made by PZ for the ET project
